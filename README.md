### Abstract 
Virtual agents serve as a vital interface within XR platforms. 
However, generating virtual agent behaviors typically rely on pre-coded
actions or physics-based reactions. In this paper we present a
learning-based multimodal agent behavior generation framework
that adapts to users’ in-situ behaviors, similar to how humans 
interact with each other in the real world. By leveraging an in-house
collected, dyadic conversational behavior dataset, we trained a 
conditional variational autoencoder (CVAE) model to achieve user 
conditioned generation of virtual agents’ behaviors. Together with
large language models (LLM), our approach can generate both the
verbal and non-verbal reactive behaviors of virtual agents. Our
comparative user study confirmed our method’s superiority over 
conventional animation graph-based baseline techniques, particularly
regarding user-centric criteria. Thorough analyses of our results
underscored the authentic nature of our virtual agents’ interactions
and the heightened user engagement during VR interaction.
